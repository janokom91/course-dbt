Part 2. Modeling challenge
CODE:
with funnel as (
select session_id,
count(distinct CASE WHEN is_page_view   = 1 THEN is_page_view ELSE NULL END) as session_started,
count(distinct CASE WHEN is_add_to_cart = 1 THEN is_add_to_cart ELSE NULL END) as add_to_cart,
count(distinct CASE WHEN is_checkout    = 1 THEN is_checkout ELSE NULL END) as checkout
from dbt_alejandro_o.fact_products
group by session_id
)

select sum (session_started), sum (add_to_cart),sum (checkout) 
from funnel

Session_started	addtocart	checkouts
578	467	361
100%	81%	77%

* How are our users moving through the product funnel?
R = important drop of 23% of users from session started to checkouts. A lot.
* Which steps in the funnel have largest drop off points?
R =f From session started to addtocart we see 19% perceptual points dropped (I think due to not every user has the intention to buy something any time he started a session) 


Part 3: Reflection questions -- please answer 3A or 3B, or both!

3A. dbt next steps for you
* if your organization is thinking about using dbt, how would you pitch the value of dbt/analytics engineering to a decision maker at your organization? - If we want transparency, scalability, reliable data and validations (all in) we definitly should use dbt
* if your organization is using dbt, what are 1-2 things you might do differently / recommend to your organization based on learning from this course? - We donâ€™t use dbt yet, but is a fact that we will
* if you are thinking about moving to analytics engineering, what skills have you picked that give you the most confidence in pursuing this next step? - Documentation and code optimization

3B. Setting up for production / scheduled dbt run of your project
